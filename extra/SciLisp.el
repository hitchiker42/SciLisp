;;; Commentary:

;; Hacked from tea.el by Olin Shivers (shivers@cs.cmu.edu). 8/88

;; This file defines a lisp-in-a-buffer package (inferior-lisp mode)
;; built on top of comint mode.  This version is more featureful,
;; robust, and uniform than the Emacs 18 version.  The key bindings are
;; also more compatible with the bindings of Hemlock and Zwei (the
;; Lisp Machine emacs).

;; Since this mode is built on top of the general command-interpreter-in-
;; a-buffer mode (comint mode), it shares a common base functionality,
;; and a common set of bindings, with all modes derived from comint mode.
;; This makes these modes easier to use.

;; For documentation on the functionality provided by comint mode, and
;; the hooks available for customizing it, see the file comint.el.
;; For further information on inferior-lisp mode, see the comments below.

;; Needs fixin:
;; The load-file/compile-file default mechanism could be smarter -- it
;; doesn't know about the relationship between filename extensions and
;; whether the file is source or executable. If you compile foo.lisp
;; with compile-file, then the next load-file should use foo.bin for
;; the default, not foo.lisp. This is tricky to do right, particularly
;; because the extension for executable files varies so much (.o, .bin,
;; .lbin, .mo, .vo, .ao, ...).
;;
;; It would be nice if inferior-lisp (and inferior scheme, T, ...) modes
;; had a verbose minor mode wherein sending or compiling defuns, etc.
;; would be reflected in the transcript with suitable comments, e.g.
;; ";;; redefining fact". Several ways to do this. Which is right?
;;
;; When sending text from a source file to a subprocess, the process-mark can
;; move off the window, so you can lose sight of the process interactions.
;; Maybe I should ensure the process mark is in the window when I send
;; text to the process? Switch selectable?

MULTIPLE PROCESS SUPPORT
===========================================================================
To run multiple Lisp processes, you start the first up
with \\[inferior-lisp].  It will be in a buffer named `*inferior-lisp*'.
Rename this buffer with \\[rename-buffer].  You may now start up a new
process with another \\[inferior-lisp].  It will be in a new buffer,
named `*inferior-lisp*'.  You can switch between the different process
buffers with \\[switch-to-buffer].

Commands that send text from source buffers to Lisp processes --
like `lisp-eval-defun' or `lisp-show-arglist' -- have to choose a process
to send to, when you have more than one Lisp process around.  This
is determined by the global variable `inferior-lisp-buffer'.  Suppose you
have three inferior Lisps running:
    Buffer              Process
    foo                 inferior-lisp
    bar                 inferior-lisp<2>
    *inferior-lisp*     inferior-lisp<3>
If you do a \\[lisp-eval-defun] command on some Lisp source code,
what process do you send it to?

- If you're in a process buffer (foo, bar, or *inferior-lisp*),
  you send it to that process.
- If you're in some other buffer (e.g., a source file), you
  send it to the process attached to buffer `inferior-lisp-buffer'.
This process selection is performed by function `inferior-lisp-proc'.

Whenever \\[inferior-lisp] fires up a new process, it resets
`inferior-lisp-buffer' to be the new process's buffer.  If you only run
one process, this does the right thing.  If you run multiple
processes, you might need to change `inferior-lisp-buffer' to
whichever process buffer you want to use.")

(defvar inferior-lisp-mode-hook '()

(define-derived-mode inferior-lisp-mode comint-mode "Inferior Lisp"
  "Major mode for interacting with an inferior Lisp process.
Runs a Lisp interpreter as a subprocess of Emacs, with Lisp I/O through an
Emacs buffer.  Variable `inferior-lisp-program' controls which Lisp interpreter
is run.  Variables `inferior-lisp-prompt', `inferior-lisp-filter-regexp' and
`inferior-lisp-load-command' can customize this mode for different Lisp
interpreters.

For information on running multiple processes in multiple buffers, see
documentation for variable `inferior-lisp-buffer'.

\\{inferior-lisp-mode-map}

Customization: Entry to this mode runs the hooks on `comint-mode-hook' and
`inferior-lisp-mode-hook' (in that order).

You can send text to the inferior Lisp process from other buffers containing
Lisp source.
    `switch-to-lisp' switches the current buffer to the Lisp process buffer.
    `lisp-eval-defun' sends the current defun to the Lisp process.
    `lisp-compile-defun' compiles the current defun.
    `lisp-eval-region' sends the current region to the Lisp process.
    `lisp-compile-region' compiles the current region.

    Prefixing the lisp-eval/compile-defun/region commands with
    a \\[universal-argument] causes a switch to the Lisp process buffer after sending
    the text.

Commands:\\<inferior-lisp-mode-map>
\\[comint-send-input] after the end of the process' output sends the text from the
    end of process to point.
\\[comint-send-input] before the end of the process' output copies the sexp ending at point
    to the end of the process' output, and sends it.
\\[comint-copy-old-input] copies the sexp ending at point to the end of the process' output,
    allowing you to edit it before sending it.
If `comint-use-prompt-regexp' is nil (the default), \\[comint-insert-input] on old input
   copies the entire old input to the end of the process' output, allowing

;;; CHANGE LOG
;;; ===========================================================================
;;; 7/21/92 Jim Blandy
;;; - Changed all uses of the cmulisp name or prefix to inferior-lisp;
;;;   this is now the official inferior lisp package.  Use the global
;;;   ChangeLog from now on.
;;; 5/24/90 Olin
;;; - Split cmulisp and cmushell modes into separate files.
;;;   Not only is this a good idea, it's apparently the way it'll be rel 19.
;;; - Upgraded process sends to use comint-send-string instead of
;;;   process-send-string.
;;; - Explicit references to process "cmulisp" have been replaced with
;;;   (cmulisp-proc). This allows better handling of multiple process bufs.
;;; - Added process query and var/function/symbol documentation
;;;   commands. Based on code written by Douglas Roberts.
;;; - Added lisp-eval-last-sexp, bound to C-x C-e.
;;;
;;; 9/20/90 Olin
;;; Added a save-restriction to lisp-fn-called-at-pt. This bug and fix
;;; reported by Lennart Staflin.
;;;
;;; 3/12/90 Olin
;;; - lisp-load-file and lisp-compile-file no longer switch-to-lisp.
;;;   Tale suggested this.
;;; - Reversed this decision 7/15/91. You need the visual feedback.
;;;
;;; 7/25/91 Olin
;;; Changed all keybindings of the form C-c <letter>. These are
;;; supposed to be reserved for the user to bind. This affected
;;; mainly the compile/eval-defun/region[-and-go] commands.
;;; This was painful, but necessary to adhere to the gnumacs standard.
;;; For some backwards compatibility, see the
;;;     cmulisp-install-letter-bindings
;;; function.
;;;
;;; 8/2/91 Olin
;;; - The lisp-compile/eval-defun/region commands now take a prefix arg,
;;;   which means switch-to-lisp after sending the text to the Lisp process.
;;;   This obsoletes all the -and-go commands. The -and-go commands are
;;;   kept around for historical reasons, and because the user can bind
;;;   them to key sequences shorter than C-u C-c C-<letter>.
;;; - If M-x cmulisp is invoked with a prefix arg, it allows you to
;;;   edit the command line.
